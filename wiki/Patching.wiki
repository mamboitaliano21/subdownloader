= How to Apply a Patch =

Ok, you just downloaded a patch and you don't have a clue how to apply it, right?

Here's the simple thing to do:
{{{
cd /path/to/subdownloader
patch -p0 <patch_file
}}}
*dont remove the '<' from there

Hope that helps. Anymore information about patching can be found [http://www.cpqlinux.com/patch.html here].
