#summary How to install and run SubDownloader on MacOS


1.Download the source files, I did this from this location:

http://subdownloader.googlecode.com/files/sources.1.2.9.zip

Extract the package using a unarchiver or the command line:

# unzip ./SubDownloader1.2.3.src.zip

2. Download and install python from here(this package also works on PPC):

http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.4.3/Universal-MacPython-2.4.3-2006-04-07.dmg

3. Download and install wxPython from here(make sure you pick the unicode 2.4 version for you architecture):

http://www.wxpython.org/download.php#binaries

4. Download IMDbPY source tarball from here:

http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/imdbpy/IMDbPY-2.8.tar.gz

Use the console and extract and install:

# cd <dir where you downloaded IMDbPY>
# tar xvzf ./IMDbPY-2.8.tar.gz
# python ./setup.py install

5. Run SubDownloader, I do this from command line, not sure if it works by clicking:

# python ./SubDownloader.py
