1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.376
Let me guess.

2
00:00:02.757 --> 00:00:05.730
You must be Xerxes.

3
00:00:17.837 --> 00:00:19.642
Come, Leonidas.

4
00:00:21.273 --> 00:00:23.547
Let us reason together.

5
00:00:23.705 --> 00:00:25.536
It would be a regrettable waste.

6
00:00:25.787 --> 00:00:27.648
It would be nothing
short of madness,

7
00:00:27.648 --> 00:00:31.932
were you, brave king, and your
valiant troops to perish.

8
00:00:32.855 --> 00:00:35.495
All because of a simple
misunderstanding.

9
00:00:35.708 --> 00:00:37.740
There is much our cultures
could share.

10
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.473
Haven't you noticed we've been sharing
our culture with you all morning?

11
00:00:41.703 --> 00:00:44.435
Yours is a fascinating tribe.

12
00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:48.451
Even now you are defiant,
in the face of annihilation.

13
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:53.633
In the presence of the god, it isn't
wise to stand against me, Leonidas.

14
00:00:53.733 --> 00:00:56.013
Imagine what horrible fate
awaits my enemies

15
00:00:56.013 --> 00:00:59.097
when I will gladly kill
any one of my own men for victory.

16
00:00:59.097 --> 00:01:01.769
And I would die
for any one of mine.

17
00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.273
You Greeks take pride
in your logic.

18
00:01:04.273 --> 00:01:06.163
I suggest you employ it.

19
00:01:06.163 --> 00:01:09.327
Consider the beautiful lands
you so vigorously defend.

20
00:01:09.327 --> 00:01:12.559
Picture it reduced to ash
at my will.

21
00:01:12.559 --> 00:01:14.652
Consider the fate of your women.

22
00:01:14.652 --> 00:01:16.954
Clearly, you don't know our women.

23
00:01:16.954 --> 00:01:19.417
I might as well have marched
them up here,

24
00:01:19.417 --> 00:01:21.407
judging by what I've seen.

25
00:01:22.269 --> 00:01:24.969
You have many slaves,
Xerxes,

26
00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:27.563
but few warriors.

27
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:31.422
It won't be long
before they fear my spears...

28
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.552
...more than your whips.

29
00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:41.150
It's not the lash they fear.

30
00:01:44.327 --> 00:01:48.930
It is my divine power.
But I'm a generous god.

31
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.541
I can make you rich beyond
all measure.

32
00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:54.284
I will make you warlord
of all Greece.

33
00:01:54.284 --> 00:01:58.176
You'll carry my battle standard
to the heart of Europa.

34
00:01:58.386 --> 00:02:03.542
Your Athenian rivals
will kneel at your feet.

35
00:02:04.163 --> 00:02:07.159
If you will but kneel at mine.

36
00:02:08.306 --> 00:02:10.318
You are generous...

37
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.692
...as you are divine.

38
00:02:14.732 --> 00:02:19.866
King of kings. Such an offer
only a madman would refuse.

39
00:02:20.748 --> 00:02:22.339
But the...

40
00:02:23.402 --> 00:02:27.425
...the idea of kneeling it's...
you see...

41
00:02:27.637 --> 00:02:34.491
Slaughtering of all those men of yours
has left a nasty cramp in my legs.

42
00:02:34.491 --> 00:02:37.254
So kneeling will be hard
for me.

43
00:02:37.254 --> 00:02:40.547
There will be no glory
in your sacrifice.

44
00:02:40.798 --> 00:02:44.520
I will erase even the memory
of Sparta from the histories.

45
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.345
Every piece of Greek parchment
shall be burned.

46
00:02:48.345 --> 00:02:50.675
Every Greek historian
and every scribe

47
00:02:50.675 --> 00:02:53.728
shall have their eyes spun out
and their tongues cut from their mouths

48
00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:59.314
whilst honoring the very name of Sparta
or Leonidas will be punishable by death.

49
00:03:00.865 --> 00:03:03.506
The world will never know
you existed at all.

50
00:03:06.332 --> 00:03:11.006
The world will know that free men
stood against a tyrrant.

51
00:03:11.006 --> 00:03:14.341
That few stood against many.

52
00:03:14.341 --> 00:03:21.306
And before this battle was over,
that even a God King can bleed.

53
00:03:28.481 --> 00:03:30.143
You fought well today.

54
00:03:32.325 --> 00:03:33.995
For a woman.

55
00:03:34.957 --> 00:03:36.735
As did you.

56
00:03:36.864 --> 00:03:39.306
Maybe you've been injured,
you weren't able to keep up with me.

57
00:03:40.546 --> 00:03:44.696
Perhaps I was so far ahead,
you couldn't see me.

58
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.723
Or were you offering
your backside to the Thespians.

59
00:03:50.244 --> 00:03:51.657
Jealousy...

60
00:03:52.041 --> 00:03:53.626
...is not becoming my friend.

61
00:03:57.286 --> 00:03:58.755
Move it, men!

62
00:04:01.466 --> 00:04:04.163
Pile those Persians high.

63
00:04:07.094 --> 00:04:09.387
For unless I miss my guess...

64
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.158
...we're in for one wild night.

65
00:04:37.423 --> 00:04:42.254
<i>They have served the dark will
of Persian kings for 500 years.</i>

66
00:04:42.796 --> 00:04:45.179
<i>Eyes as dark as night.</i>

67
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.801
<i>Teeth filed to fangs.</i>

68
00:04:49.412 --> 00:04:51.126
<i>Soulless.</i>

69
00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:01.323
<i>The personal guard
to king Xerses himself.</i>

70
00:05:01.324 --> 00:05:03.659
<i>The Persian warrior elite.</i>

71
00:05:05.605 --> 00:05:08.121
<i>The deadliest fighting
force in all of Asia.</i>

72
00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:11.400
<i>The Immortals.</i>

73
00:05:19.788 --> 00:05:22.796
<i>The God King has betrayed
a fatal flaw.</i>

74
00:05:23.655 --> 00:05:25.118
<i>Hybris.</i>

75
00:05:27.633 --> 00:05:30.230
<i>Easy to taunt.
Easy to trick.</i>

76
00:05:31.119 --> 00:05:33.580
<i>Before wounds and weariness
have taken their toll,</i>

77
00:05:33.581 --> 00:05:36.389
<i>the mad king throws
the best he has at us.</i>

78
00:05:37.769 --> 00:05:39.418
<i>Xerxes has taken the bait.</i>

79
00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:41.973
Spartans, push!

80
00:05:52.142 --> 00:05:53.654
<i>Immortals.</i>

81
00:05:54.103 --> 00:05:56.701
<i>They put their name
to the test.</i>

82
00:06:41.116 --> 00:06:42.671
Father!

83
00:08:28.262 --> 00:08:29.850
My king!

84
00:09:42.323 --> 00:09:44.878
Arcadians, now!

85
00:09:46.566 --> 00:09:47.670
Go!

86
00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:49.726
Let's show the Spartans
what we can do.

87
00:09:50.073 --> 00:09:51.453
Go!

88
00:10:00.999 --> 00:10:04.274
<i>They shout and curse,
stabbing wildly,</i>

89
00:10:04.275 --> 00:10:06.684
<i>more brawlers
than warriors.</i>

90
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.617
<i>They make a wondrous
mess of things.</i>

91
00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.321
<i>Brave amateurs.
They do their part.</i>

92
00:11:01.244 --> 00:11:02.859
<i>Immortals.</i>

93
00:11:03.339 --> 00:11:05.896
<i>They failed our kings' test.</i>

94
00:11:05.897 --> 00:11:09.331
<i>And a man who fancies
himself a god...</i>

95
00:11:09.848 --> 00:11:14.432
<i>...feels a very human chill
crawl up his spine.</i>

96
00:11:21.746 --> 00:11:22.988
For our king!

97
00:11:24.189 --> 00:11:26.490
And our honored dead!

98
00:11:26.491 --> 00:11:28.699
Whom will Xerxes dare
to send next?

99
00:11:29.624 --> 00:11:31.473
There's nothing
that can stop us now.

100
00:11:33.196 --> 00:11:36.888
<i>Even the king allows himself
to hope for more than glory.</i>

101
00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:40.439
<i>Such mad hope.
But there it is.</i>

102
00:11:40.726 --> 00:11:45.009
<i>Against Asian endless hordes,
against all odds,</i>

103
00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:48.405
<i>we can do it,
we can hold the Hot Gates.</i>

104
00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:51.115
<i>We can win.</i>

105
00:11:58.827 --> 00:12:00.333
<i>Dawn.</i>

106
00:12:01.178 --> 00:12:03.039
<i>Whips crack.</i>

107
00:12:03.136 --> 00:12:04.986
<i>Barbarians howl.</i>

108
00:12:05.415 --> 00:12:08.888
<i>Those behind cry: "Forward"!</i>

109
00:12:11.242 --> 00:12:15.049
<i>Those in front cry:
"Back".</i>

110
00:12:21.061 --> 00:12:23.821
<i>Our eyes bear witness
to the grotesque spectacle</i>

111
00:12:23.822 --> 00:12:26.993
<i>called forth from the darkest
corners of Xerxes' Empire.</i>

112
00:13:18.153 --> 00:13:22.162
<i>When muscles failed,
they turned to their magic.</i>

113
00:13:23.792 --> 00:13:26.341
<i>One hundred nations
descend upon us.</i>

114
00:13:26.342 --> 00:13:28.814
<i>The armies of all Asia.</i>

115
00:13:28.815 --> 00:13:30.891
<i>Funneled into this narrow corridor,</i>

116
00:13:30.892 --> 00:13:33.669
<i>their numbers count
for nothing.</i>

117
00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:09.408
<i>They fall by the hundreds.</i>

118
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:12.520
<i>We send the severed bodies
and the fragile hearts</i>

119
00:14:12.521 --> 00:14:15.004
<i>back to Xerxes' feet.</i>

120
00:14:32.026 --> 00:14:35.288
<i>King Xerxes is displeased
with his generals.</i>

121
00:14:36.288 --> 00:14:38.836
<i>He disciplines them.</i>

122
00:14:55.687 --> 00:14:59.127
<i>Xerxes dispatches his monsters
from half a world away.</i>

123
00:15:11.178 --> 00:15:13.142
<i>They're clumsy beasts.</i>

124
00:15:13.448 --> 00:15:16.381
<i>And the pile of Persian dead
is slippery.</i>

125
00:15:52.197 --> 00:15:54.551
- You still here?
- Someone is got to watch your back.

126
00:15:54.552 --> 00:15:56.248
Well, now, I'm a little busy.

127
00:16:36.546 --> 00:16:38.692
Regroup!

128
00:16:42.427 --> 00:16:45.278
Astinos, my son!

129
00:16:54.924 --> 00:16:56.316
Astinos!

130
00:16:56.633 --> 00:16:59.447
No!

131
00:17:22.643 --> 00:17:24.426
<i>The day wears on.</i>

132
00:17:25.203 --> 00:17:27.013
<i>We lose few...</i>

133
00:17:27.612 --> 00:17:31.558
<i>...but each felled is a friend
or dearest blood.</i>

134
00:17:32.951 --> 00:17:36.414
<i>And upon seeing the headless
body of his own young son,</i>

135
00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:39.190
<i>the captain breaks rank.</i>

136
00:17:39.191 --> 00:17:41.832
<i>He goes wild, blood drunk.</i>

137
00:18:06.985 --> 00:18:09.378
<i>Captain's cries of pain
at the loss of his son</i>

138
00:18:09.379 --> 00:18:13.186
<i>are more frightening to the enemy
than the deepest battle drums.</i>

139
00:18:13.753 --> 00:18:15.367
<i>It takes three men
to restrain him</i>

140
00:18:15.368 --> 00:18:17.429
<i>and bring him back
to our own.</i>

141
00:18:17.986 --> 00:18:19.868
<i>The day is ours.</i>

142
00:18:20.767 --> 00:18:23.293
<i>No songs are sung.</i>

143
00:19:03.525 --> 00:19:07.412
Your gods were cruel
to shape you so, friend Ephialtes.

144
00:19:10.565 --> 00:19:14.942
The Spartans, too,
were cruel to reject you.

145
00:19:18.394 --> 00:19:20.287
But I am kind.

146
00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:29.527
Everything you could
ever desire.

147
00:19:30.686 --> 00:19:32.842
Every happiness you can imagine.

148
00:19:34.688 --> 00:19:39.189
Every pleasure your fellow Greeks
and your false gods have denied you.

149
00:19:40.056 --> 00:19:42.494
I will grant you.

150
00:19:43.425 --> 00:19:45.728
For I am kind.

151
00:19:59.922 --> 00:20:02.905
Embrace me as your king
and as your god.

152
00:20:04.337 --> 00:20:05.815
Yes!

153
00:20:07.454 --> 00:20:09.775
Lead my soldiers
to the hidden path

154
00:20:09.776 --> 00:20:12.435
that empties behind
the cursed Spartans,

155
00:20:12.436 --> 00:20:14.677
and your joys will be endless.

156
00:20:23.219 --> 00:20:25.562
Yes, I want it all.

157
00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.328
Wealth, women.

158
00:20:32.274 --> 00:20:34.193
And one more thing.

159
00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:40.061
I want an uniform.

160
00:20:44.814 --> 00:20:46.564
Done.

161
00:20:48.311 --> 00:20:52.231
You will find
that I am kind.

162
00:20:53.636 --> 00:20:57.304
Unlike the cruel Leonidas
that demanded that you stand,

163
00:20:59.974 --> 00:21:04.068
I require only that you kneel.

164
00:21:31.597 --> 00:21:33.281
Beautiful night.

165
00:21:35.009 --> 00:21:38.131
Yes, but I did not ask you here
for small talk, Theron.

166
00:21:39.537 --> 00:21:40.920
I'm assured of that.

167
00:21:42.992 --> 00:21:44.999
You've never spared
words with me.

168
00:21:46.429 --> 00:21:49.206
Can I offer you something?
A drink perhaps?

169
00:21:49.799 --> 00:21:51.087
Is it poison?

170
00:21:51.934 --> 00:21:54.252
Sorry to disappoint you,
it's only water.

171
00:22:04.535 --> 00:22:07.459
I'm told it's been arranged
for you to go before the council.

172
00:22:08.399 --> 00:22:10.026
Yes.

173
00:22:10.348 --> 00:22:11.333
I need your help

174
00:22:11.334 --> 00:22:14.278
in winning votes to send
the army north to our king.

175
00:22:14.279 --> 00:22:15.280
Yes.

176
00:22:16.525 --> 00:22:19.090
I can see the two of us
standing together.

177
00:22:19.091 --> 00:22:23.267
Me, politician, thou, warrior.
Our voices as one.

178
00:22:25.069 --> 00:22:26.862
But why would I want
to do that?

179
00:22:27.462 --> 00:22:29.061
It proves you care
for a king

180
00:22:29.062 --> 00:22:31.508
who, right now, fights
for the very water we drink.

181
00:22:31.802 --> 00:22:32.998
True.

182
00:22:33.474 --> 00:22:35.800
But this is politics,
not war.

183
00:22:36.435 --> 00:22:40.171
- Leonidas is an idealist.
- I know your kind too well.

184
00:22:40.745 --> 00:22:42.611
You send men to slaughter
for your own gain.

185
00:22:42.612 --> 00:22:47.417
Your husband, our king, has taken
300 of our finest to slaughter.

186
00:22:47.418 --> 00:22:52.297
He's broken our laws and left
without the council's consent.

187
00:22:52.785 --> 00:22:55.821
- I'm simply a realist.
- You're an opportunist.

188
00:22:56.694 --> 00:22:58.026
You're as foolish as Leonidas

189
00:22:58.027 --> 00:23:00.443
if you think men
don't have a price in this world.

190
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:04.913
All men are not created equal.
That's the Spartan code, my little queen.

191
00:23:09.333 --> 00:23:11.217
I admire your passion.

192
00:23:12.937 --> 00:23:17.887
But don't think that you,
a woman, even a queen,

193
00:23:17.888 --> 00:23:20.836
can walk into the council's chamber
and sway the minds of men.

194
00:23:21.878 --> 00:23:24.032
I own that chamber.

195
00:23:24.624 --> 00:23:26.963
As if it were built
with these hands.

196
00:23:31.123 --> 00:23:33.732
I could crush the life
out of you right now.

197
00:23:35.676 --> 00:23:39.306
You will go before the council
but your words will fall in deaf ears.

198
00:23:39.668 --> 00:23:42.478
Leonidas will receive
no reinforcements,

199
00:23:42.479 --> 00:23:47.350
and if he returns, without my help,
he would go to jail or worse.

200
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.920
- Do you love your Sparta?
- Yes.

201
00:23:56.003 --> 00:23:58.588
- And your king?
- I do.

202
00:24:04.089 --> 00:24:06.493
Your husband fights
for his land,

203
00:24:06.494 --> 00:24:07.655
and his love.

204
00:24:08.548 --> 00:24:10.900
What do you have to offer?

205
00:24:11.687 --> 00:24:14.820
In return for my word that
I'll help you send our army north.

206
00:24:18.286 --> 00:24:21.455
What does a realist
want from his queen?

207
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:27.394
I think you know.

208
00:24:42.071 --> 00:24:43.944
This will not be over quickly.

209
00:24:45.817 --> 00:24:48.147
You will not enjoy this.

210
00:24:48.793 --> 00:24:51.023
I am not your king.

211
00:25:15.822 --> 00:25:16.918
Dilios!

212
00:25:19.561 --> 00:25:23.201
I trust that scracth
hasn't made you useless.

213
00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.595
Hardly, my lord.
It's just an eye.

214
00:25:27.062 --> 00:25:29.563
The gods saw fit
to grace me with a spare.

215
00:25:32.161 --> 00:25:34.028
And the captain?

216
00:25:35.364 --> 00:25:39.408
Curses the gods
and mourns alone.

217
00:25:41.119 --> 00:25:42.786
Leonidas!

218
00:25:44.038 --> 00:25:46.707
We are undone.
Undone I tell you.

219
00:25:46.874 --> 00:25:48.976
- Destroyed.
- Daxos, calm yourself!

220
00:25:49.076 --> 00:25:50.963
A hunchback traitor has led
Xerxes' Immortals

221
00:25:50.964 --> 00:25:52.465
to the hidden goat path
behind us.

222
00:25:52.545 --> 00:25:55.965
The Phocians you posted there
were scattered without a fight.

223
00:25:56.116 --> 00:25:57.950
This battle is over, Leonidas!

224
00:25:57.950 --> 00:26:01.387
This battle is over
when I say it is over!

225
00:26:01.387 --> 00:26:03.472
By morning, the Immortals
will surround us.

226
00:26:03.555 --> 00:26:05.307
The Hot Gates will fall.

227
00:26:06.517 --> 00:26:08.394
Spartans!

228
00:26:08.644 --> 00:26:11.062
Prepare for glory!

229
00:26:11.187 --> 00:26:12.313
Glory?

230
00:26:12.313 --> 00:26:13.982
Have you gone mad?

231
00:26:14.482 --> 00:26:16.442
There is no glory to be had now.

232
00:26:16.651 --> 00:26:19.983
Only retreat or surrender
or death.

233
00:26:20.018 --> 00:26:23.519
That is an easy choice for us,
Arcadian.

234
00:26:23.554 --> 00:26:28.662
Spartans never retreat.
Spartans never surrender.

235
00:26:29.663 --> 00:26:31.748
Go. Spread the word.

236
00:26:32.249 --> 00:26:36.002
Let every Greek assembled
know the truth of this.

237
00:26:36.002 --> 00:26:39.172
Let each amongst them
search his own soul.

238
00:26:40.589 --> 00:26:42.341
And while you're at it,

239
00:26:42.591 --> 00:26:44.427
search your own.

240
00:26:52.184 --> 00:26:54.186
My men will leave with me.

241
00:26:59.857 --> 00:27:01.525
Godspeed, Leonidas.

242
00:27:08.282 --> 00:27:12.535
Children! Children!

243
00:27:13.286 --> 00:27:15.038
Gather round.

244
00:27:16.872 --> 00:27:20.676
No retreat.
No surrender.

245
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:23.879
That is Spartan law.

246
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:29.134
And by Spartan law,
we will stand and fight.

247
00:27:29.884 --> 00:27:32.136
And die.

248
00:27:35.389 --> 00:27:38.267
A new age has begun.

249
00:27:40.561 --> 00:27:43.063
An age of freedom.

250
00:27:44.732 --> 00:27:48.485
And all will know that
three hundred Spartans

251
00:27:48.485 --> 00:27:52.239
gave their last breath
to defend it!

252
00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:14.009
My friend.

253
00:28:17.387 --> 00:28:22.282
I have lived my entire life
without regret until now.

254
00:28:26.353 --> 00:28:31.708
It's not that my son gave up
his life for his country.

255
00:28:34.068 --> 00:28:37.446
It's just that I never told him
I loved him the most.

256
00:28:39.698 --> 00:28:41.825
That he stood by me
with honor.

257
00:28:43.994 --> 00:28:46.538
That he was all that
was best in me.

258
00:28:55.963 --> 00:28:58.883
My heart is broken
for your loss.

259
00:28:58.884 --> 00:29:00.578
Heart?

260
00:29:06.139 --> 00:29:11.144
I have filled my heart
with hate.

261
00:29:15.273 --> 00:29:16.982
Good.

262
00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:28.660
Dilios!

263
00:29:29.494 --> 00:29:31.245
Let's take a walk.

264
00:29:33.247 --> 00:29:35.249
Yes, my lord.

265
00:29:37.585 --> 00:29:40.504
But, sire, I'm fit.
I'm ready for battle.

266
00:29:40.504 --> 00:29:42.840
That you are
one of the finest.

267
00:29:43.757 --> 00:29:46.676
But you have another talent
unlike any other Spartan.

268
00:29:50.012 --> 00:29:53.516
You will deliver
my final orders to the council

269
00:29:53.808 --> 00:29:56.102
with force and verve.

270
00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:00.606
Tell them my story.

271
00:30:01.357 --> 00:30:05.394
Make every Greek know
what happened here.

272
00:30:06.444 --> 00:30:08.780
You'll have a grand
tale to tell.

273
00:30:10.949 --> 00:30:13.076
A tale of victory.

274
00:30:13.368 --> 00:30:15.035
Victory.

275
00:30:18.831 --> 00:30:20.624
Yes, my lord.

276
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:30.634
Sire, any message...?

277
00:30:31.885 --> 00:30:33.803
...for the queen?

278
00:30:55.656 --> 00:30:58.075
None that need be spoken.

279
00:31:13.088 --> 00:31:15.675
Hundreds leave.

280
00:31:16.175 --> 00:31:18.593
A handful stay.

281
00:31:23.932 --> 00:31:26.059
Only one looks back.

282
00:31:36.485 --> 00:31:38.446
Spartans!

283
00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:43.116
Ready your breakfast
and eat hearty.

284
00:31:43.116 --> 00:31:47.120
For tonight we dine in Hell!

285
00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:02.551
May I give the floor now to the wife
of Leonidas and queen of Sparta.

286
00:32:17.231 --> 00:32:18.899
Councilmen.

287
00:32:19.233 --> 00:32:22.736
I stand before you
not only as your queen.

288
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:26.448
I come to you as a mother.

289
00:32:27.907 --> 00:32:30.243
I come to you as a wife.

290
00:32:32.245 --> 00:32:34.872
I come to you
as a Spartan woman.

291
00:32:39.802 --> 00:32:42.337
I come to you
with great humility.

292
00:32:46.124 --> 00:32:48.606
I am not here to represent
Leonidas.

293
00:32:48.693 --> 00:32:51.829
His actions speak louder
than my words ever could.

294
00:32:51.929 --> 00:32:54.294
I am here for all those voices
which cannot be heard.

295
00:32:54.365 --> 00:32:56.729
Mothers, daughters, fathers, sons.

296
00:32:56.808 --> 00:33:00.687
Three hundred families
that bleed for our rights

297
00:33:00.687 --> 00:33:03.857
and for the very principles
this room is built upon.

298
00:33:04.424 --> 00:33:06.943
We're at war, gentlemen.

299
00:33:06.943 --> 00:33:09.593
We must send the entire spartan
army to aid our king

300
00:33:09.594 --> 00:33:13.228
in the preservation of not just
ourselves but of our children.

301
00:33:13.282 --> 00:33:16.444
Send the army for
the preservation of liberty.

302
00:33:16.535 --> 00:33:18.620
Send it for justice.

303
00:33:19.038 --> 00:33:21.373
Send it for law and order.

304
00:33:21.373 --> 00:33:23.425
Send it for reason.

305
00:33:23.508 --> 00:33:27.211
But, most importantly,
send our army for hope.

306
00:33:27.879 --> 00:33:31.715
Hope that the king and his men have
not been wasted in the pages of history.

307
00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:35.469
That their courage
bonds us together.

308
00:33:35.969 --> 00:33:39.014
That we are made stronger
by their actions.

309
00:33:40.207 --> 00:33:44.186
And that your choices today
reflect their bravery.

310
00:33:46.074 --> 00:33:47.660
Three hundred.

311
00:33:55.771 --> 00:33:57.656
Moving.

312
00:33:57.781 --> 00:34:01.076
Eloquent, passionate.

313
00:34:01.159 --> 00:34:05.263
But it doesn't change the fact
that your husband has brought war upon us.

314
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:06.831
You are wrong.

315
00:34:06.831 --> 00:34:08.211
Xerxes brought it forth

316
00:34:08.233 --> 00:34:10.844
and before that,
his father, Darius, at Marathon.

317
00:34:10.851 --> 00:34:14.629
The Persians will not stop until
the only shelter we will find

318
00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:16.480
is rubble and chaos.

319
00:34:16.490 --> 00:34:20.677
This chamber needs
no history lesson, my queen.

320
00:34:20.844 --> 00:34:23.179
Then what is the lesson
you would like to leave?

321
00:34:23.262 --> 00:34:25.598
Shall I begin to enumerate
all of them?

322
00:34:25.598 --> 00:34:29.218
Honor, duty, glory.

323
00:34:29.268 --> 00:34:31.270
You speak of honor?

324
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:34.557
Duty? Glory?

325
00:34:35.608 --> 00:34:37.242
But what of adultery?

326
00:34:37.342 --> 00:34:39.962
- How dare you?
- How dare I?

327
00:34:40.028 --> 00:34:43.064
Watch her, carefully.

328
00:34:43.114 --> 00:34:46.283
She is a trickster
in true form.

329
00:34:46.283 --> 00:34:49.787
Do not play with the members
of this sacred chambers, my queen.

330
00:34:49.787 --> 00:34:52.956
Just hours ago, you offered
yourself to me.

331
00:34:52.956 --> 00:34:57.329
Were I a weaker man,
I'd have her scent on me still.

332
00:34:57.428 --> 00:35:00.681
- This is outrage.
- Ah, the hypocrite speaks.

333
00:35:00.714 --> 00:35:02.689
Did you not receive
a similar payment?

334
00:35:02.765 --> 00:35:07.252
Which you took in exchange for her
having an audience with these noble men.

335
00:35:07.303 --> 00:35:09.121
- That is a lie.
- Is it?

336
00:35:09.138 --> 00:35:13.339
Was he not, by your invitation, asked
to come the king's bedchamber?

337
00:35:13.425 --> 00:35:16.329
The very bed where you attempted
to negotiate with me

338
00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:19.032
so vigorously.

339
00:35:20.865 --> 00:35:22.567
You look shocked.

340
00:35:22.567 --> 00:35:24.289
A bribe of the flesh,
gentlemen,

341
00:35:24.324 --> 00:35:28.156
whilst her husband
promotes anarchy and war.

342
00:35:32.325 --> 00:35:35.495
Words escape even
the most cunning tongues.

343
00:35:35.996 --> 00:35:38.498
My little whore queen.

344
00:35:42.702 --> 00:35:45.337
What queen-like behaviour!

345
00:35:46.088 --> 00:35:49.408
Remove her from this chamber
before she infects us further

346
00:35:49.408 --> 00:35:53.011
with her inglorious
and filthy self.

347
00:35:58.850 --> 00:36:01.602
This will not be over quickly.

348
00:36:02.070 --> 00:36:04.522
You will not enjoy this.

349
00:36:04.522 --> 00:36:06.691
I am not your queen.

350
00:36:28.127 --> 00:36:29.712
Traitor.

351
00:36:30.546 --> 00:36:32.715
Traitor, traitor, traitor.

352
00:37:14.586 --> 00:37:18.172
Leonidas.
My compliments.

353
00:37:18.256 --> 00:37:20.591
And congratulations.

354
00:37:20.842 --> 00:37:24.595
You surely have turned calamity
to victory.

355
00:37:24.595 --> 00:37:28.015
Despite your insufferable
arrogance,

356
00:37:28.015 --> 00:37:31.334
the God King has come to admire
Spartan valor

357
00:37:31.334 --> 00:37:32.936
and fighting skills.

358
00:37:32.936 --> 00:37:34.084
You will make a mighty ally.

359
00:37:34.121 --> 00:37:36.439
Yield, Leonidas.

360
00:37:36.856 --> 00:37:40.943
Use your reason.
Think of your men.

361
00:37:43.112 --> 00:37:44.947
I beg you.

362
00:37:45.114 --> 00:37:46.982
Listen to your fellow Greek.

363
00:37:47.066 --> 00:37:51.036
He can attest to the divine
one's generosity.

364
00:37:51.152 --> 00:37:53.789
Despite your several insults,

365
00:37:53.789 --> 00:37:56.457
despite your horrid
blasphemies,

366
00:37:56.457 --> 00:38:00.011
the lord of hosts is prepared
to forgive all.

367
00:38:00.045 --> 00:38:03.063
And more: to reward
your service.

368
00:38:03.047 --> 00:38:06.751
You fight for your lands.
Keep them.

369
00:38:07.635 --> 00:38:09.887
You fight for Sparta.

370
00:38:09.887 --> 00:38:13.640
She will be wealthier and more
powerful than ever before.

371
00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:16.810
You fight for your kingship.

372
00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:19.896
You will be proclaimed warlord
of all Greece.

373
00:38:19.896 --> 00:38:24.483
Answerable only to the one
true master of the world.

374
00:38:24.483 --> 00:38:29.371
Leonidas. Your victory
will be complete.

375
00:38:29.404 --> 00:38:35.393
If you but lay down your arms
and kneel to holy Xerxes.

376
00:39:05.988 --> 00:39:10.859
<i>It's been more than 30 years
since the wind and the winter cold.</i>

377
00:39:10.959 --> 00:39:15.947
<i>And now, as then, it's not
fear that grips him.</i>

378
00:39:15.947 --> 00:39:17.754
<i>Only restlesness.</i>

379
00:39:17.849 --> 00:39:21.369
<i>A heightened sense of things.</i>

380
00:39:21.952 --> 00:39:26.957
<i>The seaborne breeze cooly kissing
the sweat on his chest and neck.</i>

381
00:39:26.958 --> 00:39:28.462
<i>Gulls cawing,</i>

382
00:39:28.559 --> 00:39:32.879
<i>complaining even as they feast
on thousands of floating dead.</i>

383
00:39:34.281 --> 00:39:38.811
<i>The steady breathing
of the 300 at his back.</i>

384
00:39:40.252 --> 00:39:44.223
<i>Ready to die for him,
without a moment's pause.</i>

385
00:39:46.408 --> 00:39:51.897
<i>Every one of them
ready to die.</i>

386
00:40:06.676 --> 00:40:09.829
<i>His helmet is stifling.</i>

387
00:40:30.032 --> 00:40:33.017
<i>His shield is heavy.</i>

388
00:40:40.274 --> 00:40:42.693
Your spear.

389
00:40:50.917 --> 00:40:52.702
You there.

390
00:40:52.703 --> 00:40:55.049
Ephialtes.

391
00:40:59.842 --> 00:41:02.294
May you live forever.

392
00:41:09.601 --> 00:41:12.220
Leonidas, your spear.

393
00:42:18.564 --> 00:42:21.700
Stelios!

394
00:42:30.542 --> 00:42:32.710
Slaughter them!

395
00:42:35.379 --> 00:42:39.083
<i>His helmet was stifling.
It narrowed his vision.</i>

396
00:42:39.166 --> 00:42:41.601
<i>And he must see far.</i>

397
00:42:41.636 --> 00:42:45.472
<i>His shield was heavy.
It threw him off balance.</i>

398
00:42:45.889 --> 00:42:49.810
<i>And his target is far away.</i>

399
00:43:54.151 --> 00:43:58.455
<i>The old ones say we Spartans
have descended from Hercules himself.</i>

400
00:44:00.232 --> 00:44:03.793
<i>Bold Leonidas gives testament
to our bloodline.</i>

401
00:44:04.626 --> 00:44:09.382
<i>His roar is long and loud.</i>

402
00:44:38.873 --> 00:44:40.244
My king.

403
00:44:52.838 --> 00:44:57.259
It's an honor to die at your side.

404
00:44:58.010 --> 00:45:02.097
It's an honor to have lived
at yours.

405
00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:25.868
My queen.

406
00:45:33.459 --> 00:45:35.711
My wife.

407
00:45:47.022 --> 00:45:49.190
My love.

408
00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:17.011
<i>Remember us.</i>

409
00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:21.923
<i>As simple an order
as a king can give.</i>

410
00:48:23.898 --> 00:48:27.118
<i>Remember why we died.</i>

411
00:48:28.903 --> 00:48:32.706
<i>For he did not wish tribute
or song.</i>

412
00:48:34.708 --> 00:48:39.045
No monuments, no poems
of war and valor.

413
00:48:41.965 --> 00:48:44.300
His wish was simple.

414
00:48:49.672 --> 00:48:51.974
Remember us.

415
00:48:52.741 --> 00:48:55.060
He said to me.

416
00:48:56.178 --> 00:48:58.563
<i>That was his hope.</i>

417
00:48:58.597 --> 00:49:02.967
<i>Should any free soul
come across that place</i>

418
00:49:03.067 --> 00:49:06.920
<i>in all the countless
centuries yet to be,</i>

419
00:49:06.987 --> 00:49:13.175
<i>may all our voices whisper to you
from the ageless stones.</i>

420
00:49:14.244 --> 00:49:17.998
<i>Go tell the Spartans,
passerby,</i>

421
00:49:18.531 --> 00:49:24.503
<i>that here, by Spartan law,
we lie.</i>

422
00:49:27.339 --> 00:49:29.925
<i>So my king died...</i>

423
00:49:30.759 --> 00:49:33.429
<i>And my brothers died.</i>

424
00:49:35.096 --> 00:49:38.266
Barely a year ago.

425
00:49:42.337 --> 00:49:47.695
Long I pondered my king's
cryptic talk of victory

426
00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:50.232
and the time has proven
him wise.

427
00:49:51.289 --> 00:49:54.498
For from Greek to free Greek

428
00:49:54.564 --> 00:49:59.067
the word was spread that bold
Leonidas and his 300,

429
00:49:59.135 --> 00:50:01.370
so far from home,

430
00:50:01.437 --> 00:50:04.743
laid down their lives,
not just for Sparta,

431
00:50:04.773 --> 00:50:09.298
but for all Greece and the promise
this country holds.

432
00:50:09.661 --> 00:50:14.699
And now, here on this ragged
patch of earth called Platea,

433
00:50:14.849 --> 00:50:19.471
Xerxes' hordes face obliteration.

434
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:24.892
Just there, the barbarians huddle.

435
00:50:25.309 --> 00:50:28.395
Sheer terror gripping tight

436
00:50:28.762 --> 00:50:32.280
their hearts with icy fingers.

437
00:50:32.366 --> 00:50:35.601
knowing full well what merciless
horrors they suffered

438
00:50:35.686 --> 00:50:38.821
at the swords and spears
of three hundred.

439
00:50:39.627 --> 00:50:42.922
Yet they stare now,
across the plain,

440
00:50:42.957 --> 00:50:47.866
at 10.000 Spartans,
commanding 30.000 free Greeks.

441
00:50:55.554 --> 00:50:59.423
The enemy outnumbers us
a paltry three to one.

442
00:50:59.623 --> 00:51:02.176
Good odds for any Greek.

443
00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:07.180
This day we rescue a world
from mysticism and tyranny

444
00:51:07.264 --> 00:51:10.934
and usher in a future brighter
that anything we can imagine.

445
00:51:16.005 --> 00:51:18.107
Give thanks, men...

446
00:51:18.157 --> 00:51:21.527
to Leonidas and the
brave three hundred.

447
00:51:22.111 --> 00:51:25.453
To victory!
